### Create Your Databases

```console
buffalo pop create -a
buffalo pop migrate
```

## Starting the Application

Buffalo ships with a command that will watch your application and automatically rebuild the Go binary and any assets for you. To do that run the "buffalo dev" command:

```console
buffalo dev
```

If you point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) you should see the Completion Tracker homepage.
